            If you intend your bot to be run by other people,
            <format style="bold">you are responsible for informing them about the data collection system!</format>
        </p>

            The easiest way to do this is to link to this page, but the way you handle this is up to you.

    </warning>

    <p>
        As of version 2, Kord Extensions includes a data collection feature.
        Every 30 minutes, this feature collects some statistical data from your bots, submitting it to
        <a href="https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/data-collector">an open-source server</a> run and controlled by the
        Kord Extensions team.
    </p>

    <p>
        This feature is intended to provide the developers with guidance on where to focus their efforts as well
        as interesting statistical information that will be made available to everyone.

		<p>
			If you're maintaining a fork of Kord Extensions, we'd appreciate it if you could update your fork to
			identify itself in our collected statistics.
			To learn how to do this, please
			<a href="https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions/blob/root/kord-extensions/src/main/kotlin/dev/kordex/core/datacollection/DataCollector.kt#L99">

    <chapter title="General Info" id="general">
        <p>
            Data collected is stored on a server located in Germany, owned by
            <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>.
            This data is encrypted at rest (along with all backups) and is secured through containerization, network
            isolation, and other standard security practices.
        </p>

        <p>
            The data collected is not sold and is only shared with the Kord developers.
			Direct access is limited to <a href="https://github.com/gdude2002">the Kord Extensions lead maintainer</a>
			and <a href="https://github.com/DRSchlaubi">one of Kord's core developers</a>.
            However, graphs and summaries based on that data, without bot/team information, are made available to
            the public.
        </p>

        <p>
            All data submissions are assigned a UUID, which is stored by your Kord Extensions bot via a storage unit.
            While we believe the data collected is not considered personal information under the GDPR, we provide
            several mechanisms that allow you to use this UUID for data retrieval and removal:
        </p>

        <list type="bullet">
            <li>
                <p>
                    By changing your data collection level to None (as explained below), your Kord Extensions bot
                    will stop collecting data and will use the UUID to delete any stored data from the data collection
                    server.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    The UUID may be used to directly access the data collection API:
                </p>

                <list type="bullet">
                    <li>
                        HTTP GET: <code>https://data.kordex.dev/data/:uuid</code> - retrieve the stored data for the
                        given UUID.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        HTTP DELETE: <code>https://data.kordex.dev/data/:uuid</code> - delete the stored data for the
                        given UUID.
                    </li>
                </list>

                <p>
                    We may decide to create a simple UI for this later.

            The default data collection level (assuming nothing has been configured) is Standard.

        <p>
            Kord Extensions provides the following data collection levels.

        <chapter title="None" id="levels-none">
            <p>
                Setting this level will disable data collection.

                If you had a different level set previously, Kord Extensions will delete your data from the
                data collection server.

            <p>
                This data is stored through a storage unit, via the data adapter system.
                By default, this means data will be stored in <code>./data/</code>, but you can change that by
                supplying another data adapter, such as
                <a href="https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/kord-extensions/tree/root/modules/data/data-mongodb"
