This is especially true when dealing with an uncommon or poorly-documented software license &mdash; such as the EUPL, which is the primary license we use as of Kord Extensions v2.</p><aside class="prompt" data-type="warning" data-title="" id="z9gmyt6_5"><p id="z9gmyt6_10">While we've tried to provide as much information as we can under our understanding of the EUPL, <span id="z9gmyt6_12"><b>we are not lawyers and this document does NOT constitute legal advice.</b></span></p><p id="z9gmyt6_11"><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/eupl-text-eupl-12" id="z9gmyt6_13" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">The EUPL text</a> always takes priority over anyone's opinions, but we hope to clarify a few things by explaining how we interpret it.</p></aside><section class="chapter"><h2 id="about" data-toc="about">About the license</h2><p id="z9gmyt6_14"><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/introduction-eupl-licence" id="z9gmyt6_17" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to the European Commission</a>, the EUPL is a copyleft license, designed to be compatible with other copyleft licenses when combined downstream into a larger work &mdash; and to be interoperable, according to European copyright law. It includes multiple translated versions which hold equal legal value, covers distribution through a network (such as Discord), and includes a Developer Certificate of Origin.</p><p id="z9gmyt6_15">What this ultimately means is that the EUPL functions like a more compatible and interoperable AGPL, including a network use clause, but also a linking exception. Instead of containing its own definition for what a derivative work is, it defers to European copyright law &mdash; specifically, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex:31991L0250" id="z9gmyt6_18" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">Directive 91/250/EEC</a>, re-codified <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32009L0024" id="z9gmyt6_19" data-external="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">2009/24/EC</a>.</p><p id="z9gmyt6_16">It additionally defers to the copyright law of the EU member state where the project owner resides, or the one defined within the files' license headers, if provided.
